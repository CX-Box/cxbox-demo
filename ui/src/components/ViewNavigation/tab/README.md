# How to add a new tab type:
1. Add new type name to NavigationTypes
2. In the current directory, create a folder with a name corresponding to the new type of navigation.
3. Implement a new navigation component and related functionality in the resulting folder. You can use a ready-made display component from the "../ui/ViewTabs" directory.
4. Add the resulting component to "../../ViewNavigation.tsx"
